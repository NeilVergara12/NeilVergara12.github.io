            <p>Adidas is a German athletic apparel and footwear corporation headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria,
              Germany. It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after
              Nike. It is the holding company for the Adidas Group, which also owns an 8.33% stake of the football club
              Bayern Munich, and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas's revenue for 2018 was listed
              at €21.915 billion.</p>
            <p>The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house. He was joined by his elder brother Rudolf
              in 1924 under the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted in
              the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of
              spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas
              and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer
              Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas
              and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival.</p>
            <p>The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe designs
              as a marketing aid. The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for
              the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey, became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as
              "The three stripes company".</p>
